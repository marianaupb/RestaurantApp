# Restaurantapp
Final project for Server Programming - Autumn 2019 (under construction :) )
I'm still doing modifications in the code and I want to make a mobile app in the future and insert a better front-end.

Admin page = username: admin; password: admin
Add first the Chef; then the week; then the recipe;

Displaying automatically the last input instead of the current week. I'm gonna fix it.
